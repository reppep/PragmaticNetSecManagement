#Executive Guide to Pragmatic Network Security Management

##Overview

This paper targets CISOs of organizations with larger and more complex networks that struggle to maintain effective and efficient network security. It outlines a pragmatic process for managing network security by establishing a baseline, then setting up core processes and workflows to sustain it over time.

The report is in the file `PragmaticNetsec.md`.

##Open Research Process

Securosis has long followed our [Totally Transparent Research process](https://securosis.com/about/totally-transparent-research), where we post all draft research on the blog for public comment and review. I am experimenting with using GitHub as a more interactive way of opening up this process, so people can directly propose and submit changes. This will also expose more of our editing process.

This paper is being posted as a complete first draft, but most papers will be posted in pieces as we post them on the blog. We will collect feedback from both systems, especially because this paper is our first foray into using GitHub to write and host research.

Please post suggestions here, or feel free to email me at rmogull@securosis.com.
